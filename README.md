# HOW TO USE
Unix system is preferable
# Install sample data in the Progtest website
You can see the "Download" button under the condition of the problem
After installation move this "sample.tgz" to your project directory
# Then run "python3 script.py" in your project directory
Or "python3 script.py project-name" if you have the script in another folder.
PS: Change the "project-name" to destination to your project directory
